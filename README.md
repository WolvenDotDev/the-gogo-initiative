# the-gogo-initiative

The GoGo Initiative is my personal project focused on learning the Go programming language. I started this journey because I'm fascinated by Go's growing influence in modern software development.

The project began on Christmas 2024, when I started building simple Go applications using examples from [gobyexample.com](http://gobyexample.com). This website offers a practical, hands-on introduction to Go's fundamentals.

Beyond these basic examples, I've expanded the project to include larger applications by reimagining my college assignments from ITB. I've rebuilt projects from my Data Structures & Algorithm, Object Oriented Programming, and Web Development courses using Go.
