# the-gogo-initiative

The GoGo Initiative is a personal project revolving around the learning process of the Go programming language. The reason being I’m just really curious about Go and it’s progress of taking over the modern industry. 

This project was started on Christmas of 2024 by first building simple go apps referring to examples provided by [gobyexample.com](http://gobyexample.com). The website provides surface level hands-on introduction to the go language.

Apart from doing examples for fundamentals, the project also has larger scaled apps by rebuilding college assignments during my time in ITB. I re-engineered several assignment projects in classes such as Data Structures & Algorithm, Object Oriented Programming, and Web Development.
